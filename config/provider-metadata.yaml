                instances that can perform the login operation that they be associated with
                the subnet ID that matches the value specified by this field. auth_type

                - (Optional) IF set to true, only allows a
                single token to be granted per instance ID. This can only be set when
                auth_type is set to ec2.
            inferred_aws_region: |-
                - (Optional) When inferred_entity_type is set, this
                is the region to search for the inferred entities. Required if
                inferred_entity_type is set. This only applies when auth_type is set to
                iam.
            inferred_entity_type: |-
                - (Optional) If set, instructs Vault to turn on
                inferencing. The only valid value is ec2_instance, which instructs Vault to
                infer that the role comes from an EC2 instance in an IAM instance profile.

            resolve_aws_unique_ids: |-
                - (Optional, Forces new resource) Only valid when

                resolved to AWS Unique
                IDs
                for the bound principal ARN. This field is ignored when a
                bound_iam_principal_arn ends in a wildcard. Resolving to unique IDs more
                closely mimics the behavior of AWS services in that if an IAM user or role is
                deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
                roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior
                principals of the same name. Defaults to true.
                Once set to true, this cannot be changed to false without recreating the role.

                for this field should be the key of the tag on the EC2 instance. auth_type
                must be set to ec2 or inferred_entity_type must be set to ec2_instance
                to use this constraint.
            token_bound_cidrs: |-
                - (Optional) List of CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP
                addresses which can authenticate successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks
                as well.
            token_explicit_max_ttl: |-
                - (Optional) If set, will encode an
                explicit max TTL
                onto the token in number of seconds. This is a hard cap even if token_ttl and
                token_max_ttl would otherwise allow a renewal.
            token_max_ttl: |-
                - (Optional) The maximum lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
                Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
            token_no_default_policy: |-
                - (Optional) If set, the default policy will not be set on
                generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set in token_policies.
            token_num_uses: |-
                - (Optional) The maximum number
                of times a generated token may be used (within its lifetime); 0 means unlimited.
            token_period: |-
                - (Optional) If set, indicates that the
                token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
                duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
                value of this field. Specified in seconds.
            token_policies: |-
                - (Optional) List of policies to encode onto generated tokens. Depending
                on the auth method, this list may be supplemented by user/group/other values.
            token_ttl: |-
                - (Optional) The incremental lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
                Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.
            token_type: |-
                - (Optional) The type of token that should be generated. Can be service,
                batch, or default to use the mount's tuned default (which unless changed will be
                service tokens). For token store roles, there are two additional possibilities:
                default-service and default-batch which specify the type to return unless the client
                requests a different type at generation time.

                the write operation is not available to the resource or included in
                state. This helps to avoid accidental storage of sensitive values in
                state. Some endpoints, such as many dynamic secrets endpoints, return
                data from writing to an endpoint rather than reading it. You should
