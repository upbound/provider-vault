                      the write operation is not available to the resource or included in
                      state. This helps to avoid accidental storage of sensitive values in
                      state. Some endpoints, such as many dynamic secrets endpoints, return
                      data from writing to an endpoint rather than reading it. You should
                      use write_fields if you need information returned in this way.
