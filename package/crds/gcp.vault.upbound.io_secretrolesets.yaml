                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
