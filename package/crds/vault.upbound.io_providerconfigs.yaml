                  Credentials required to authenticate to this provider.
                  There are many options to authenticate. They include
                  - token - (Optional) Vault token that will be used
                  by Terraform to authenticate. May be set via the
                  VAULT_TOKEN environment variable. If none is otherwise
                  supplied, Terraform will attempt to read it from
                  ~/.vault-token (where the vault command stores its
                  current token). Terraform will issue itself a new token
                  that is a child of the one given, with a short TTL to
                  limit the exposure of any requested secrets, unless
                  skip_child_token is set to true (see below). Note
                  that the given token must have the update capability
                  on the auth/token/create path in Vault in order to create
                  child tokens. A token is required for the provider. A
                  token can explicitly set via token argument, alternatively
                  a token can be dynamically set via an auth_login* block.
