                      auth_type is iam. If set to true, the bound_iam_principal_arns are
                      resolved to AWS Unique
                      IDs
                      for the bound principal ARN. This field is ignored when a
                      bound_iam_principal_arn ends in a wildcard. Resolving to unique IDs more
                      closely mimics the behavior of AWS services in that if an IAM user or role is
                      deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
                      roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior
                      principals of the same name. Defaults to true.
                      Once set to true, this cannot be changed to false without recreating the role.
                      Whether or not Vault should resolve the bound_iam_principal_arn to an AWS Unique ID. When true, deleting a principal and recreating it with the same name won't automatically grant the new principal the same roles in Vault that the old principal had.

                      deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
                      roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior

                      deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
                      roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior
