                  It is not honored unless the relevant Crossplane feature flag is
                  enabled, and may be changed or removed without notice. ManagementPolicies
                  specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to take on the
                  managed and external resources. This field is planned to replace
                  the DeletionPolicy field in a future release. Currently, both could
                  be set independently and non-default values would be honored if
                  the feature flag is enabled. If both are custom, the DeletionPolicy
                  field will be ignored. See the design doc for more information:
